Go back to the last slide.

-   "What is React?"
    -   At this point we should know it consists of: components, state, props and JSX. This is to show how simple React really is; and how it isn't that complicated.
    -   To build interactivity, we combine callbacks (methods) with props, and state
    -   It's best practice as apps get bigger, it solves a huge problem that massive projects have faced in the past. This is why people love react. React has these walls to guide you in this style of mentality. So when you build apps, you are using good practices.

-   Review the thinking in components
    -   Show the final result on a web browser and explain breaking down components
        -   Card is a self contained component
        -   There are many cards, therefore a list component will be needed
        -   Some form of a container will be needed
        -   Search component
        -   Header

This ends the React training. See if anybody has any questions or
comments about the course.
