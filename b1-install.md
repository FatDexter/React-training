## Getting Redux

- Redux is available through npm: `npm install redux`

- There is also a package that provides easy interoperability between redux and react called _react-redux_. `npm install react-redux`

- react-redux makes integration easier but is not absolutely necessary

## Redux DevTools

Redux DevTools is a debugging tool that allows you to:

- easier visualize your application's current state
- move forward and backwards throughout your state (time travelling!)
- Available for Chrome, Firefox and Electron and other environments
