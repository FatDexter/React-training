-   Go into a coding directory

-   Run command: **create-react-app Robodex**

-   Change to that directory and run **npm start**

-   Show the audience the browser that opened with the app running

-   Open a code editor in the src folder

-   TODO: set your code editor theme for high contrast and easy to read (large font)
    -   Might be a good idea to split screen with code editor and browser to
        show how hot reloading works

-   Show index.js code and explain the ReactDOM.render().

-   Use this opportunity to change App component to a hello world example (in a div).
