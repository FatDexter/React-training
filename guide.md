## General

-   Let the audience pick the high level topics and perhaps you don't need to cover some
    -   You can give a brief overview of the topics and let the audience pick what they want

-   Simple demo

-   Trivia/Crossword puzzle, statements with a blank that they can fill in the blank

-   Intelligent Interrupts
    -   Structure into your talk, breaks for the audience to interact
    -   Encourage a conversation about the topic
    -   Permission to interact
    -   Two sticky notes; one for passive help and one for active help

-   Balanced chance to speak, sticky note to indicate if you've spoken already to prevent over contributor

-   Bring paper, pens, and encourage doodling

-   Quiz them
    -   Mind maps; draw them while listening and compare at intervals
        -   Compare mind map at the end to my mind map; this encourages people to pay attention
