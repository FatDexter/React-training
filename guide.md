## General

-   Let the audience pick the high level topics and perhaps you don't need to cover some
    -   You can give a brief overview of the topics and let the audience pick what they want

-   Simple demo

-   Trivia/Crossword puzzle, statements with a blank that they can fill in the blank

-   Intelligent Interrupts
    -   Structure into your talk, breaks for the audience to interact
    -   Encourage a conversation about the topic
    -   Permission to interact
    -   Two sticky notes; one for passive help and one for active help

-   Balanced chance to speak, sticky note to indicate if you've spoken already to prevent over contributor

-   Bring paper, pens, and encourage doodling

-   Quiz them
    -   Mind maps; draw them while listening and compare at intervals
        -   Compare mind map at the end to my mind map; this encourages people to pay attention

-   Build something that represents the thing you were talking about
    -   I.e. building blocks to represent a pipeline of processes

### [Conclusion](/a7-conclusion/)

- Go over each of the main concepts of React: components, state, props and JSX. This is to show how simple React really is; and how it isn't that complicated.
- Go back and show how what has been done so far connects to what React is in essence:
    - Reactive since views are re-rendered on state updates
    - Declarative since renders are pure and can be expressed as a single JSX expression
    - The app is built from the composition of small components
-  To build interactivity, we combine callbacks (methods) with props, and state
-  It's best practice as apps get bigger, it solves a huge problem that massive projects have faced in the past. This is why people love React. React has these walls to guide you in this style of mentality. So when you build apps, you are using good practices.
